# Chain Drivers
The Chain Driver interface is where everything that is chain-specific is implemented. We provide a few already implemented ChainDrivers in this folder for your convenience. You can also choose to implement the ChainDriver interface on your own. If you do this, it would be greatly appreciated if it shared with us, so we can add it to this library! See below.

# Current Supported Chains
* **Algorand** via the AlgoDriver file

# How to Contribute a New Chain Implementation
Create a pull request with the following:
* This README file updated
* SupportedChains.ts updated
* The root directory README file updated
* The new chain driver file added to the ChainDrivers folder

A brief description, links, and example demo repositories would also be greatly appreciated.
